I am an incoming Ph.D. student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, supervised by [Prof. Tianshu Yu](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/yutianshu/). 

Before that, I obtained my master's degree from University College London, where I was fortunate to work under the supervision of [Dr. Oana-Maria Camburu](https://cvlab-liuyuanyuan.github.io/) and [Prof. Pontus Stenetorp](https://pontus.stenetorp.se/).

My research interest includes multimodal learning, human-computer interaction and AI4Science.
